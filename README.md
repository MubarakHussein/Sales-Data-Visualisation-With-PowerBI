## 💡 Skills Demonstrated

### 📊 1. Visualizations

Utilized various Power BI chart types to represent key metrics and sales patterns effectively:

- **Line Chart** – Displayed monthly/quarterly sales trends over time.
- **Stacked Bar Chart** – Compared sales performance by product categories and regions.
- **Map Visualization** – Plotted regional sales distribution using geolocation data.
- **Filled Map** – Visualized sales density and regional performance in a heatmap-style view.

These visualizations helped to communicate complex data in a clear and interactive format.
